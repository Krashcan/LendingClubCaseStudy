# Loan Default Risk Analysis for Urban Customers
> This project focuses on analyzing the risk of loan default among urban customers. By examining past loan application data, we aim to identify patterns that might indicate a person's likelihood of defaulting. This analysis will aid in making informed decisions on loan approvals, potentially leading to actions like denying the loan, adjusting the loan amount, or modifying interest rates for high-risk applicants.

## General Information
- **Background**: The project originates from the need of a consumer finance company to optimize loan approval decisions. The primary goal is to balance the risk of financial loss against the opportunity for profit.
- **Business Problem**: The main challenge is to accurately predict the likelihood of an applicant defaulting on a loan. This involves analyzing various factors related to the consumer's profile and the loan characteristics.
- **Dataset**: The analysis utilizes a dataset containing historical information on loan applicants, including personal and loan-specific attributes, and whether they defaulted on their loan.


## Conclusions
- **Conclusion 1**: Higher loan amounts and lower annual income lead to more defaults
- **Conclusion 2**: Low grade values like E, F, G are risker compared to A, B, C
- **Conclusion 3**: Higher interest rates directly lead to higher defaults
- **Conclusion 4**: High loan term periods lead to higher defaults
